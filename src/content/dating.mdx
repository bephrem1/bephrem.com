title: The Future of Online Dating Will Be Mostly Offline
date: January 2025
---

> I’m currently prototyping an offline-first dating service called [Bind](https://joinbind.com/). I share my
thought process on ideating an approach to building in a notoriously difficult space.

I’ve become very curious about what the future of online dating will look like. This makes sense given
that I’m a single male in my mid-20s who hasn’t had a great time on dating apps (for various reasons).
I have a vested interest in understanding the problem & finding an optimal solution.

In algorithm analysis, we constantly ask ourselves “is this the best we can do?”. We get a deep theoretical
understanding of the problem, theorize an optimal performance given the constraints (not yet knowing the exact
solution), then work towards a concrete solution achieving that performance.

We also aim to identify solutions that cannot exist, or may appear to be possible, but are impossible for one
reason or another. Above all, we never settle for a solution that is “good enough”.

In this case, the problem is that of finding a highly compatible longterm partner. The best (online) solution for that
today is Hinge (maybe Bumble, not Tinder). We will try to understand what comes after these services (2025 & beyond),
given the condition & desire of users today.

Before we continue (since it is relevant to the credibility of this writing), this is what I look like:

## Prior Art

### “Broken” vs Endemic

When people say “online dating today is broken,” they often aren’t very clear on “what” is broken. To create a better
solution, it’s important we draw a distinction between problems _created within_ online dating services, & problems that arise
from the very _nature_ of how humans make mating choices.

The nature of a problem is immutable. If all complaints we can generate reduce simply to human nature & the mating decision
process, we have nothing further to act on or investigate. This would mean we are at an equilibrium (albeit a very
uncomfortable one).

We will draw a line between dissatisfaction:
- endemic to human mating in any context
- arising from the online dating experience (making highly selective mating choices in a context of little information, an online
profile)
- arising from other sources (causes we may or may not be able to change)

#### The Dating “Marketplace”

Human mating operates as a two-sided competitive market. It is a bit clinical to use the term “market” here, but being precise will
be important to us framing the problem correctly. It will give us tools to understand the nature of platforms & see into the future (more on this later).

Every individual has a goal, and a strategy to achieve that goal. Strategy can be consciously known to the individual, or
completely subconscious.

Any dating service has to decide how “fair” it will be in its matching process, since it must help users move towards their goals. While
not necessarily a zero sum game, one user’s gain may lead to another user’s lost opportunity.

<Aside>We will not attempt to define what “fair” means for an online dating platform, but it is a very important concept to define. Many
users’ interests will be at contention with one another. It could mean giving users an even distribution of impressions to potential matches,
showing them to matches of relatively equal desirability, clustering their profile impressions to potential matches in  geographic regions
close to them, etc.</Aside>

<Aside>Most services will implement some form of [stable matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) algorithm to propose
stable pairings (see [Gale-Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm)). Services must infer who would
prefer whom.</Aside>

A solution that is globally “fair” (one that aims to maximize the surface area under the “user satisfaction curve”) will not
be a solution where every *individual* user is maximally satisfied.

Even in a maximally “fair” service, as in any competitive two-sided market, there will always be some portion of individuals who,
given their strategy:
- **completely fail** to achieve their goals
- **partially fail** to achieve their goals
- **partially succeed** in achieving their goals
- **completely succeed** in achieving their goals

Mate choice, by design, is not fair. Evolution has encoded within us the drive to favor some as mates, and disfavor others.

No matter how fair or unfair the design of a dating service, this core of selectivity will exist. There will always be a set of individuals
left selected out, or only able to attain a partially successful outcome, and subsequently dissatisfied in not meeting their goals.

According to Pew Research, over 50% of online dating users report somewhat negative, to very negative, experiences dating online<sup>[1]</sup>. Is
this necessarily an actual problem? Is dating broken? Or are online platforms only surfacing data that has never been available to us before about
human selectivity.

What should be of most interest to us is the middle of the distribution. Partially satisfied users and partially dissatisfied users who could experience
better matchmaking (or a better user experience). This is where there are things to be done.

In financial markets, different market microstructures result in different distributions of participant success. To move the dating success
distribution, you have to fundamentally rethink the user experience that sets the distribution.

### Today’s Options

To understand where we’re going, it’s important to understand where we’re currently at. If you decided that you wanted to find your partner online
in 2025, what choices would you have?

#### The Match Group Machine

Tinder, Bumble, & Hinge are the largest online dating services in the U.S., constituting ~85% of the online dating market. Marketshare breaks down
roughly like this (founding date added for context):
- Tinder (~40% — f. 2012)
- Bumble (~25% — f. 2014)
- Hinge (~20% — f. 2011)
- Others:
  - Plenty of Fish (POF) (~4% — f. 2003)
  - OkCupid (~4% — f. 2003)
  - Match.com (~3% — f. 1995)
  - Grindr (~3% — f. 2009)
  - The League (~2% — f. 2014)
  - BLK (~1% — f. 2017)
  - BlackPeopleMeet (~1% — f. 2002)
  - ... and the list goes on

Only Bumble & Grindr remain independent & are not owned by Match Group. Match Group controls ~70% of the U.S. online dating market.

<Aside>Match Group is essentially building a mosaic of companies whose business models have proven themselves after 5+ years, filling in gaps in
their portfolio. Hinge, proving itself as the “relationship app”, was acquired for a 51% stake in 2018 (at ~$10-20M revenue), later growing to
[full ownership](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/match-fully-acquires-relationship-focused-app-hinge/) in 2019. Revenue would 10x over the next
5 years to ~$300M in 2024. The League, proving itself as the app for “elite singles”, was [acquired](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meimeifox/2023/09/18/first-intimate-interview-with-the-league-founder-amanda-bradford-since-30-million-match-group-acquisition/)
for $30M in 2022, 8 years after it’s founding. Companies trying new models that die, disappear, those that live long enough end up being acquired
by Match Group.</Aside>

Is Match Group a monopoly? Is there anything anti-competitive going on here? According to the FTC website<sup>[2]</sup>:

<Quote>As a first step, courts ask if the firm has “monopoly power” in any market. This requires in-depth study of the products sold by the leading firm,
and any alternative products consumers may turn to if the firm attempted to raise prices. Then courts ask if that leading position was gained or
maintained through improper conduct—that is, something other than merely having a better product, superior management or historic accident. Here
courts evaluate the anticompetitive effects of the conduct and its procompetitive justifications.</Quote>

While Match Group may hold dominant marketshare & controls almost all alternative products people may turn to, they don’t have to engage in much
anti-competitive conduct to maintain their marketshare.

The difficulties in bootstrapping a new dating service from scratch are naturally insurmountable. The nature of marketplaces protect them.

#### The Importance of Options

One of the most important characteristics of any market is abundance of choice. Nobel prize winning economist Alvin E. Roth calls this property
“thickness”. The more options, the thicker the market.

You’ve likely heard the term “liquidity” in financial markets. Usually we think of it in one direction, the ease of selling an asset to convert it
back into fungible currency. But it goes both ways, those wanting to buy a certain allotment hope for ease in completing their transaction as well.

Larry Harris in “Trading & Exchanges” offers a simple definition<sup>[3]</sup>:

<Quote>Liquidity is the ability to trade when you want to trade. Some orders *offer liquidity* by presenting other traders with trading
opportunities. Other orders take liquidity by seizing those opportunities. Traders decisions to offer or take liquidity therefore affect market
quality.</Quote>

Access to options in a market is so important that market makers (market participants that “make a market” by always offering to buy or sell an
asset, even in the absence of “regular” buyer or sellers providing price information) are willing to pay brokers for orders to be routed to them
(called “payment for order flow”, PFOF).

Options are highly valuable & competed for, because they allow market participants to have more opportunities to meet their goals (at lower cost), reducing
difficulty in solving the search problem.

Fragmentation is the enemy of market density. It divides trading options amongst various separate databases (and even completely separate geographic
locations), increasing difficulty in solving the search problem.

<Aside>It is common for financial exchanges to consolidate when large synergies are present. Bringing all options under one roof allows for more efficient
matching of buyers & sellers. One example is the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) and CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade) [merging in 2007](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-and-cbot-merge-creating-25-billion-premier-global)
to form CME Group, Inc.</Aside>

Markets that cannot gain enough momentum either fail, or end up merging into a larger entity to gain the density needed to solve the search problem.

#### Most of the Jobs Are Done

So what does this have to do with online dating? The largest online dating platforms hold the most options, and the services with the most dating options
will create a natural pull for users to transition to them to better solve their search problem.

Hinge is “the relationship app”, with intentional design choices (like making it a first-class UI concern to send a message on prompts or photos) made to
slow down the user experience and make it more deliberate. Tinder is “the hookup app” (whether they want to call it that or not), with a much faster
experience of rapidly swiping through photos (to the point only physical attraction is considered).

American academic Clayton Christensen formalizes this in the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework, stating that the unit on which to assess consumer choice is
not their concrete demographics (age, race, gender, etc), but rather “jobs to be done” in their lives.

In a talk at Google<sup>[4]</sup> he says:

<Quote>
... I have all kinds of other characteristics and attributes, as you can see. But none of my characteristics or attributes have yet caused me to buy
The New York Times today. There might be a correlation between the propensity that I will buy the The New York Times. But my characteristics don’t cause
me to buy it. ... And yet, almost all of the work that we do in assessing market potential, we look at the characteristics or attributes of the potential
customers. <Highlight>And a better way to think of [consumer choices], we decided, is that...darn it. Everyday, stuff happens to us. Jobs arise in our life.
And when these jobs arise, we need to find some way to get the jobs done.</Highlight> And some of the jobs are simple incremental things that happen regularly.
Others are dramatic and important breakthrough problems. But whenever we have a job to do, we have to find something and *pull* it into our lives in order
to get the job done. <Highlight>And what we decided is understanding the job is the critical key to develop products that we can predictably make and find the customers
to buy.</Highlight>
</Quote>

A mistake many entrepreneurs will make building new dating platforms is that they will propose incremental improvements to the user experience,
without understanding the underlying job users are hiring them to solve.

Markets usually progress in “windows of opportunity”, some macro change happens (a technological breakthrough, a new social norm, etc), then there is
fertile ground for certain kinds of companies to take root & grow. Then after 2, 3, 4 years — the window slowly closes, competition means:
- customers have many choices, the bar on features goes higher
- cost of entry to reach feature parity goes up
- employees become harder to hire
- capital becomes harder to raise
- crafting unique marketing messaging becomes harder

In the early 2010s (recall Tinder was founded in 2012, Hinge 2011, Bumble 2014), mobile phones presented such a window. Since people took their phone everywhere,
users could join & be active on services in record numbers. Throughout the decade, users began to “hire” different services to solve problems they were
now more capable of solving.

Tinder popularized the “double opt-in” model of matching where both individuals in a match had to mutually “like” each other before a match was made. Most
of the 2010s would be various startups building different permutations of this model, in different geographies, for different demographics.

The final result, with the dust fully settled from the 2010s, was Hinge, Bumble, & Tinder owning 85% of the U.S. online dating market.

The gravitational pull of these largest services finally formed, & the core jobs to be done mostly filled, left little room to substantiate the existence
of other services. So the late 2010s, & early 2020s saw little to no innovation.

##### Credit Cards in the 1960s

A similar industry shakeout occurred in the U.S. credit card industry in the late 1960s.

Before credit cards, payments would either be done by cash or check. This presented issues for merchants because they would have to take on the credit
risk of each of their customers directly. If a customer provided a check that bounced, the merchant risked losing the payment.

Credit card companies would take on the payment risk of each customer directly, extending a credit line to them. The credit card company would gaurantee
payments to merchants for a small “interchange fee” (usually 1-3%). The customer would become indebited to the credit card company, & later pay down their
account.

Diners Club (f. 1950) was the first independent payment card company in the world, pioneering this charge card model. They both issued their cards &
operated as a payment network. They partnered directly with restaurants, hotels, travel agencies, & entertainment venues to process payments.

The 1960s saw the emergence of general-purpose credit cards, as well as the rise of competing card networks like Master Charge (now Mastercard),
BankAmericard (now Visa), & American Express (f. 1850, but released their own charge card).

Payment networks experienced the same runaway consolidation that we see in other matching markets. The more merchant banks a payment network partnered
with, the more merchants accepted their payments, the more valuable a card became to cardholders (you could pay in more places with the same card).

By 2023, marketshare in the U.S. by purchase volume<sup>[5]</sup> looked like this:
- Visa (~52.2% — f. 1958)
- Mastercard (~24.13% — f. 1966)
- American Express (~19.78% — charge card, f. 1958)
- Discover (~3.87% — f. 1985)

No major payment networks aside from the handful started around this time exist today. 

##### Attempts to Innovate

When customers have hired enough services to solve their jobs, an equilibrium is quietly reached. This steady state may not look pleasant, and could be
far from perfect, but it is the best the market can possible yield given incumbent lock-in.

There has to be a strong, visceral, shift in consumer preference for a new service to substantiate it’s existence. If this is not present, services
will just fizzle out after an initial enthusiastic burst of growth (later followed by a slow demise).

What probably happened to any companies attempting to innovate in the late 2010s, early 2020s, is they would start with the premise that “online dating
today is broken”, then launch an app with some incremental user experience change:
- longer-form profiles
- scheduling a time & place for a date upon matching
- orient around a game-like experience

What will happen is that many people will get excited and there will be an initial burst of enthusiasm that this new service will hold the solution to
all of their online dating woes (whatever the cause).

Since everyone will have this problem, and many will be single, there will be a rush of tens of thousands of users in the first year or so.

But what will happen is that, as the months go by, users will start to churn. The same endemic problems that arose in other online services will
slowly germinate from a seed & take root.

Even if the service somehow reaches a critical mass of users, the same systemic biases & hyperselectivity will arise once again. Eventually users will
start deciding to leave for existing services. The ones with the most options, hoping that something will have changed in the time they were away.

Roughly 64% of dating app users have only 1 app installed on their phone & 17% have 2 (meaning ~81% have at most 2 apps installed). This leaves very
little room for patience with alternatives.

##### A Quiet Decade */}

{/* ---



Those who wish to compete will usually start a service, gain tens of thousands of users in year 1, then eventually fizzle out when the fail to retain
users. The users will eventually transition over to a Match Group service.

There are actually great synergies to building a holding company around online dating services. Each company is solving the same problem in
different geographies, for different demographics (age, race, etc), so having a single company with a large repository of data, proprietary algorithms
determined from years of testing & observation, and the marketing power to cross-pollinate between sites offers consumers a better end-product.

It is not in the public’s interest, or in each company’s interest, to operate separate databases of singles who all have the same objective.





Each dating service solving the same cold-start
problem








While Match Group does have dominant market share, it actually doesn’t need to maintain it through anti-competitive means. The nature of markets protect




Is Match Group a monopoly? Is there is anything anti-competitive going on here? I’m not an anti-trust lawyer, so I consulted the Federal Trade Commission’s
website:
