          There was a gap for ~2–3 years after Leetcode grew in popularity (in ~2017) to create
          better video explanations for software engineering interview problems. AlgoExpert ended up
          taking up most early market share (more credible founders, distributed better, product
          solidified to become better), reaping millions in profits.

          ~’21/’22 the DS/A market started becoming commoditized, with YouTubers creating large
          content libraries for free & a flood of new paid courses. (there still existed a large gap
          for a central system design instructional authority since that content is much harder to
          create, which since has been filled by ByteByteGo).

          In September of ’23 while still running Interview Pen, I moved to San Francisco to work on
          a real-time mock interviewing platform for software engineers. It seemed the next natural
          thing to work on, the course business was faltering & real-time LLM-based AI conversation
          was becoming more & more technically feasible every month.

          The developer experience was nascent to non-existent for this use-case at the time, so I

          My co-founder left the project that December (we did not see eye-to-eye on our respective
