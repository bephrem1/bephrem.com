            I founded and ran Back To Back SWE from December 2018 to Novermber
            2020 when a majority of the company was acquired. This timespan was
            one of the most challenging in my life at every stage. I was
            compelled to create the solution I wanted to see in the world. It is
            a really long story. The learnings are etched in our minds.

      <h2 class="underline">Education</h2>
      <p>
        Computer Science in college is the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Very
        theoretical and rigorous.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          B.S., Computer Science, University of Maryland College Park (2021)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="underline">Skills</h2>
      <p>
        I’m like a generalist in a software engineer’s body. Programming &
        engineering is my core skillset, but I can be workingly competent in
        many areas like design, marketing, sales, copy-writing, etc. because
        while running a business you think about (and do) every function at all
        times.
      </p>

      <h2 class="underline">Qualities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I like thinking in systems and functions</li>
        <li>
          If I think there is something I need to do worth doing I will not stop
        </li>
        <li>I am obsessive about completion</li>
        <li>
          I always seek the truth of any situation. What is really going on
          here? (whether code, or a lesson topic, or in life)
        </li>
      </ul>
